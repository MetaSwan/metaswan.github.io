# Malware disguised as a resume
---

This malware is one of the variants of the APT attack that the Kimsuki group has continued to attack South Korea.
This variant, created on February 27, 2020, is a file titled "이력서 양식.hwp.scr"("resume sample.hwp.scr" in English), 
which looks like a hwp file but as a scr (screen saver extension but executable as an exe) file.
When executed, the script is executed and the Hangeul document file with the actual resume form is loaded as follows.

# Analysis

MD5 : [47c95f19ebd745d588bb208ff89c90ba](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/757dfeacabf4c2f771147159d26117818354af14050e6ba42cc00f4a3d58e51f?environmentId=120)

It's a fairly complex piece of malware that can't be easily analyzed statically.
Therefore, I tried analysis is based on behavior.
When executed, the actions are as follows :

## Create files
---
 1. C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Temp\ÀÌ·Â¼­ ¾ç½Ä.hwp
 2. C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Temp\654A.tmp.db 
 3. C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Temp\67DB.tmp.bat
 4. C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Temp\65E7.tmp.bat
 5. C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Defender\AutoUpdate.dll
 
 ### ÀÌ·Â¼­ ¾ç½Ä.hwp
 ---
 After execution, the .scr file is replaced by this .hwp file. Actual resume form file.
  
 ### 654A.tmp.db
 ---
 It is actually a dll and is injected into explorer.exe.

 ### 67DB.tmp.bat
 ---
 Batch script that deletes the first executable file(.scr file). 
 
 ### 65E7.tmp.bat
 ---
 This batch script deletes the 654A.tmp.db file.

 ### AutoUpdate.dll
 ---
 It is actually an exe executable and performs actual malicious behaviors such as connecting to the C & C server, tampering the registry, and injecting explorer.exe.

## Network connections
---

http://suzuki.datastore.pe.hu (45.13.135.103:80) Attempt to connect to the C & C server.

Download additional malicious files through http://suzuki.datastore.pe.hu//?m=a&p1=5254004a04af&p2=win_6.1.7601-x32_DROPPER.

p1 contains the mac address, and p2 contains the version of Windows.

## Registry tampering
---

Register AutoUpdate.dll with Registry Server using regsvr32.exe. Make it run every time the computer starts.

## Injecting to explorer.exe 
---

AutoUpdate.dll registered through regsvr32.exe infects explorer.exe.
The execution graph is as follows:  Source [app.any.run](https://app.any.run/)

If you check the memory dump of explorer.exe, you can see that the malicious code is inserted inside explorer.exe.
